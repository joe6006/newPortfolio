                <p>Hey there! I'm a software developer in training, currently making the leap into tech after working in a different field. It's been an exciting journey full of learning and growth.
                I'm also a proud dad, which means I’ve mastered the art of multitasking and patience! When I'm not diving into code, you'll probably find me gaming — it's my favorite way to unwind and stay inspired. I'm passionate about building cool things and looking forward to starting a new chapter in my career.
                </p>
