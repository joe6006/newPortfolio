# newPortfolio
portfolio built with react.JS

I built this portfolio in a Death Stranding 2 theme, I will be changing the themes depending on the games I am currently playing.
as I get beter so will the website.
as of right now I have to move on to other project so will be on hiatus little while.
I used embla react to get the slideshow going on the desktop version, documentaion made it super easy to use.

**this website is noit yet media queried for tablet sor maybe some smaller sizes of laptop, this will change when I have more
time to work on this project


***ALL PHOTOS WERE TAKEN USING PHOTO MODE ON DEATH STRANDING 2 : ON THE BEACH
